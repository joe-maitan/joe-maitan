`Software Engineer`

I am a new graduate deeply interested in learning more about cloud technologies and how I can use them to further my software development. My GitHub contains a collection of projects that are course related or personal projects I developed! I love programming and software in because it has scratched that itch in my brain of problem solving. If you're looking for more insight into my experience, then check out my [LinkedIn][link-to-that].
